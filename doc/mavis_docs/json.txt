  \page json JSON instruction definition

  \section intro Introduction

  Instructions are defined in JSON format, as a list of dictionaries.

  For example:
  \code
  [
    {
        "mnemonic" : "addi",
        "form" : "ISH",
        "ignore" : ["func6"],
        "xform" : "I",
        "stencil" : "0x13",
        "type" : ["int", "arith"],
        "l-oper" : "all"
    },
    {
        "mnemonic" : "nop",
        "overlay" : {
            "base" : "addi",
            "match" : ["0xFFFFFF80", "0x00000000"]
        },
        "xform" : "I",
        "type" : ["int", "arith"]
    },
  ]
  \endcode

  \section instr_def Instruction definition
  Each instruction is defined by a number of required and optional fields in the JSON stanza.
  These are parsed in DTable::parseInstInfo_

  At the very least you need the following fields:
  - `mnemonic`: instruction mnemonic
  - `stencil`: hex value encoding the instruction stencil (opcode + function fields)
  - `form`: instruction format as defined in RISC-V ISA spec, these correspond to what
  is defined in Form.h and the corresponding extraction logic in ExtractorForms.h. A few examples:
     - `R`, `I`, `S`, `U`, `B`, `J`
     - `AMO` for atomic instructions
     - `CSR` for CSR instructions
     - `Rfloat` for FP register instructions
  
  The following fields are optional:
  - `expand`: for compressed instructions. gives mnemonic of instruction to exapand to
  - `xform`: extraction form override
  - `overlay`: overlay instructions. Overlay instructions don't require form, but need to have `xform` instead. 

  Metadata. The following fields are not used by Mavis to build the instructions themselves,
  but they are added as metadata (mavis::InstMetaData stored in mavis::InstMetaDataRegistry):
  - `data`: data size
  - Operand size:
    - `w-oper`: Word operand types
    - `l-oper`: Long operand types
    - `s-oper`: Single operand types
    - `d-oper`: Double operand types
    - `q-oper`: Quad operand types
    - `v-oper`: Vector operand types
  - `type`: Instruction type: list of possibly multiple keywords, eg ["int", "arith"]

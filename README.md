# Mavis

Mavis is a framework that allows decoding of the RISC-V ISA into
custom instruction class types as well as custom extensions to those
class types.

Mavis is not a massive switch-case statement that most RISC-V decoders
are.  Instead, Mavis intelligently builds a decode table or DTable
with a digital tree or [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) to
decode the instructions.

## Basics of the Design

Mavis' design is based on the notion there are two parts to every
decoded instruction:

1. Static information like instruction type, execution target units,
   data width, etc.  This information is the same regardless of an
   opcode's specifics.  For example, an `lw` is always loading 32-bits
   of data regardless of the source/destination registers

1. Dynamic information like which registers are being sourced/written,
   immediate field information, instruction modes, etc.

On initialization of the Mavis decoder, Mavis instantiates the static
information immediately for each instruction in the ISA.  The dynamic
information is generated based on the specific opcode encountered.

To instantiate the tree with static information, Mavis uses JSON files
populated with instruction definitions to build the Trie at
runtime.  Each instruction definition contains at minimum a stencil
taht defines how that instruction is decoded:

```
 {
    "mnemonic" : "amoxor.d",
    "stencil" : "0x2000302f",
    ...
 }
```

The Trie is built using these stencils.  The data structure at each
node of the tree is a factory or `IFactory` that Mavis uses to build
the dynamic information or more specifically the modeler's instruction
type.   This is what's returned to the user.

The user can supply "micro-architectural" information to extend the
instruction as it is being created using micro-architectural JSON files.

[mavis_docs](https://github.com/sparcians/mavis/tree/main/doc) to

## Using Mavis

### Build Mavis/Add to Project

To add Mavis to a project, if using `cmake`, make Mavis a submodule or
provide a local clone.  Then add the following to the project's CMakeLists.txt:

```
# Bring in the mavis project/CMakeLists.txt to build Mavis
add_subdirectory (<path to mavis>)

# Bring in the include path, no warnings from compilers
include_directories (SYSTEM mavis)

# Needed for Mavis to find the JSON files (path to be changed by the user)
file(CREATE_LINK <path to mavis>/json ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/mavis_isa_files SYMBOLIC)

# Link Mavis with project
target_link_libraries(<project> mavis)
```

### Instantiating the Decoder

Mavis needs class definitions for the Static Information and the
Dynamic Information as described in [Basics of the Design](#Basics-of-the-Design).

Example Static information class: [uArchInfo](https://github.com/sparcians/mavis/blob/main/test/basic/uArchInfo.h)

Example Dynamic information class: [Instruction](https://github.com/sparcians/mavis/blob/main/test/basic/Inst.h)

Mavis **requires** that the user classes (both Static and Dynamic classes) define a type called `PtrType`:

```c++
   class MyDynamicInstructionType
   {
   public:
       typedef typename std::shared_ptr<MyDynamicinstructiontype> PtrType;
       // ...
   };
```
Mavis only keeps track of heap-allocated objects.  The
allocation/deallocation of these objects can be managed/changed via
the template parameters to Mavis.

> **_NOTE_** Mavis' allocator works well with GNU allocators as well
> as Sparta's
> [SpartaSharedPointerAllocator](https://sparcians.github.io/map/classsparta_1_1SpartaSharedPointerAllocator.html)
> class.

In addition, the constructor for the Dynamic instruction is required
to take Mavis specific opcode information as well as the Static
information created by the modeler.  This is how the Dynamic part of
the instruction is connected to Mavis' detailed/static information.

```c++
   class MyDynamicInstructionType
   {
   public:
       typedef typename std::shared_ptr<MyDynamicinstructiontype> PtrType;

       MyDynamicInstructionType(const typename mavis::OpcodeInfo::PtrType & opcode_info,
                                const typename MyStaticInstructionType::PtrType & new_ui,
                                ... other construction arguments pass through by makeInst);

   };
```

Instantiate a Mavis instance:
```c++
#include "mavis/Mavis.h"

#include "MyStaticInstructionType.hpp"
#include "MyDynamicInstructionType.hpp"

using MavisType = mavis::Mavis<MyDynamicinstructiontype, MyStaticInstructionType>;

...

{
    // Create a mavis decoder that can only decode rv64imf
    MavisType mavis_decoder({"mavis_isa_files/isa_rv64i.json",
                             "mavis_isa_files/isa_rv64m.json",
                             "mavis_isa_files/isa_rv64f.json"},
                             {"my_uarch_extensions_to_rv64imf.json"});

    // Make add 1,2 3
    MyDynamicInstructionType::PtrType inst = mavis_decoder.makeInst(0x003100b3,
                               /* other construction info for MyDynamicInstructionType */);

    // do stuff with the instruction
}
```

### Using the Extension Manager

The ExtensionManager is a power set of classes that allow the parsing
of an ISA string and returning a Mavis instance that adheres to the
given ISA.  If there are conflicts in that ISA string (extensions that
conflict with other extensions, the manager will throw an exception.

Example:
```c++

    const std::string rv_isa = "rv64imac_zicond_zicsr_zifencei_zawrs_zihintpause_zilsd_zabha_zacas_zfa";

    mavis::extension_manager::riscv::RISCVExtensionManager extension_manager =
        mavis::extension_manager::riscv::RISCVExtensionManager::fromISA(
            rv_isa, "json/riscv_isa_spec.json", "json");

    std::unique_ptr<MavisType> mavis_decoder
        = std::make_unique<MavisType>(
            extension_manager.constructMavis<MyDynamicinstructiontype,
                                             MyStaticinstructiontype>({"my_uarch_extensions_to_rv64imf.json"}));

```

### Run regression

Regression is mostly manual and entails the developer to build a basic
tester application, run it, and compare the output against a golden
reference.

* Build library, output will be `libmavis.a`
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
```
* Build the basic tester; output program is `Mavis`
```
cd build/test/basic
make -j8
```
* Execute the basic tester and compare golden `out`
```
./Mavis > test.out
diff -s test.out golden.out
```

* Build and test with a directed program; output program is
  `mavis_decode`.  This program allows a user to test the validity of
  an opcode or a mnemonic.  This program requires boost program
  options to be installed on the host machine.

```
cd build/test/directed
make
./mavis_decode --help
./mavis_decode -a rv32g -o 0x0001a283
./mavis_decode -a rv64g -o 0x0001b283
./mavis_decode -a rv32gc -z -o 0x6008
